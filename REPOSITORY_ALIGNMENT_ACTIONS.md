# Repository Alignment Investigation Plan

## Project Alignment Goal
### Objective: Initialize Stable Main Branch
**Primary Mission**: Establish version 0.1.0 as the initial release

#### Goal Criteria
- Create a clean, version-tagged main branch
- Incorporate all current development work
- Prepare for future development cycles

### Preparatory Context
Previous investigative actions have:
- Mapped current project state
- Identified repository configuration
- Validated development environment
- Prepared for seamless migration

### Approach
- Leverage existing project structure
- Minimize disruption to current work
- Ensure smooth transition to versioned main branch

## Investigation Roadmap

## 1. Local Codebase Investigation

- Multiple configuration and documentation improvements
- Working on a feature branch with pending changes
- No changes currently committed

## 2. GitHub Repository Exploration
- [x] Examine local repository configuration
  - [x] Run `git remote -v`
  - [x] Check existing remotes
  - [x] Verify current branch structure
- [x] Check GitHub repository status
  - [x] Verify repository existence
  - [x] List existing branches
  - [x] Review current repository settings

### Findings: Repository Configuration
#### Remote Repository Details
- **Remote Name**: `origin`
- **Repository URL**: `https://github.com/jmarc580625/medialocate.git`
- **Access**: Configured for both fetch and push

#### Repository Configuration Insights
- Single remote repository configured
- Personal GitHub repository
- Direct push and fetch capabilities

#### Recommended Actions
1. Verify GitHub repository access and permissions
2. Confirm repository visibility settings
3. Validate branch protection rules
4. Review repository settings for CI/CD compatibility

## 3. Version and Dependency Management
- [x] Validate Poetry configuration
  - [x] Run `poetry env info`
  - [x] Check Python version compatibility
  - [x] Verify dependency resolution

### Findings: Poetry and Environment Configuration
#### Virtual Environment Details
- **Python Version**: 3.12.8
- **Implementation**: CPython
- **Virtual Environment Path**:
  ```
  c:\Users\s231853\OneDrive - Eviden\Documents\development\medialocate\.venv
  ```
- **Base Python Location**:
  ```
  C:\Users\s231853\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_3.12.2288.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0
  ```

#### Environment Insights
- Using latest Python 3.12 version
- Dedicated virtual environment created
- Windows-based development environment
- Virtual environment is valid and properly configured

### Dependency Management Considerations
#### Recommended Actions
1. Verify `pyproject.toml` for dependency specifications
2. Check for any version constraints
3. Ensure compatibility with project requirements
4. Review development and production dependencies

### Updated Alignment Strategy
#### Dependency and Version Management
- Leverage existing Poetry configuration
- Prepare for version 0.1.0 initialization
- Validate dependency compatibility
- Ensure smooth transition to main branch

### Next Investigation Steps
- Detailed review of `pyproject.toml`
- Comprehensive dependency audit
- Prepare for potential dependency updates
- Align version management with project goals

### Potential Risks and Mitigations
- Python 3.12 might have compatibility issues with some packages
- Recommend creating a requirements.txt for broader compatibility
- Consider creating a compatibility matrix
- Prepare fallback strategy for dependency resolution

## 4. Code and Repository Integrity
- [ ] Run comprehensive code checks
  - [ ] Execute `poetry run pre-commit run --all-files`
  - [ ] Check linting results
  - [ ] Verify type checking
  - [ ] Run test suite

### Test Suite Investigation
- [x] Verify test file existence
  - Found 21 test files across directories:
    * Integration tests: 6 files
    * Release validation tests: 3 files
    * Unit tests: 12 files

- [x] Diagnose pytest configuration issue
  - Restored `-k "not release_validation"` option
  - Purpose: Exclude release validation tests from standard test runs

### Test Suite Configuration
- [x] Separate pytest configuration
  - Created `pytest.ini` file
  - Moved configuration from `pyproject.toml`
  - Added `norecursedirs` to exclude release validation tests

### Configuration Changes
- Removed pytest settings from `pyproject.toml`
- Created dedicated `pytest.ini`
- Configured test path and exclusion rules
- Preserved existing coverage and reporting settings

### Recommended Verification
1. Run pytest to confirm test discovery
2. Verify exclusion of release validation tests
3. Check test coverage reporting

### Test Coverage Findings
- Total test coverage: 30.87%
- Coverage requirement: 80%
- Significant gaps in code coverage

### Recommended Actions
1. Install `toml` package
2. Review and update release validation tests
3. Improve overall test coverage
4. Investigate low coverage areas in source code

- [ ] Backup current codebase
  - [ ] Create a complete project backup
  - [ ] Ensure no data loss during realignment

## 5. Alignment Strategy Preparation
- [x] Document current project state
  - [x] Create a detailed snapshot of existing configuration
  - [x] Note any unique local setup characteristics

### Alignment Strategy Adjustments
### Previous Assumptions
- Initial plan assumed potential repository misalignment
- Discovered an existing, configured remote repository

### Updated Alignment Approach
- Focus on branch management
- Prepare for version 0.1.0 initialization
- Ensure clean migration of current work
- Minimize disruption to existing repository structure

### Revised Investigation Priorities
- Verify current branch structure
- Assess existing GitHub Actions workflows
- Prepare for main branch version initialization
- Develop strategy for merging current feature branch

### Next Immediate Steps
- Commit or stash current changes in `feature/test-ci`
- Verify GitHub repository settings
- Prepare for main branch version setup

## Detailed Actions to Initialize Main Branch

### 1. Prepare Current Branch
- [x] Identify current branch: `feature/test-ci`
- [ ] Stage all changes
- [ ] Commit staged changes with descriptive message
- [ ] Verify no uncommitted modifications
- [ ] Ensure clean working directory

### Commit Message Template
```
chore(release): prepare branch for v0.1.0 release

- Finalize version initialization
- Prepare for main branch migration
- Consolidate current development state
```

### 2. Version Initialization
- [x] Update `pyproject.toml`
  - [x] Set version to "0.1.0"
  - [x] Verify version in all relevant files
- [x] Create CHANGELOG.md with initial release notes
- [x] Update README.md with version information

### 3. Branch Management
- [ ] Checkout main branch
  - If main doesn't exist: `git checkout -b main`
  - If main exists: `git checkout main`
- [ ] Merge `feature/test-ci` into main
- [ ] Create version tag `v0.1.0`

### 4. Remote Repository Synchronization
- [ ] Push main branch to remote
- [ ] Push version tag to remote
- [ ] Verify branch protection rules

### 5. Validation
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify CI/CD workflow triggers
- [ ] Confirm version consistency

### Potential Rollback Strategies
- Preserve `feature/test-ci` branch
- Maintain backup of current state
- Document initial migration steps

## Objectives
- Comprehensive understanding of current project state
- Identify potential challenges in repository alignment
- Prepare a safe and systematic approach to version management
- Ensure code and configuration integrity during migration

## Expected Outcomes
- Detailed project status report
- Clear migration strategy
- Minimized risk of data loss or configuration conflicts
