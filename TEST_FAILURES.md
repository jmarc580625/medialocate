# Test Failures to Address

## Group Proxy Tests
- [ ] `test_proxies_initialization` in `test_group_proxy.py`
  - Expected empty proxies dict but got populated values
  - Need to investigate initialization logic in `group_proxy.py`

## Media Server Unit Tests
1. [ ] `test_get_media_sources` in `test_media_server_unit.py`
   - Expected items_dict length of 1 but got 0
   - Check media source scanning logic

2. [ ] HTTP Handler Tests in `test_media_server_unit.py`
   - Missing required attributes in TestHandler:
     - [ ] `requestline` for `test_handle_albums`
     - [ ] `client_address` for `test_handle_proxy`
     - [ ] `directory` for `test_translate_path`
   - Need to properly mock HTTPRequestHandler attributes

3. [ ] `test_validate_url` in `test_media_server_unit.py`
   - URL validation not working as expected
   - Invalid URLs being marked as valid
   - Check URL validation logic in media_server.py

## Notes
- Overall test coverage is good at 87% (above 80% requirement)
- Focus on fixing test logic rather than changing implementation
- Consider adding proper setup/teardown for HTTP handler tests
